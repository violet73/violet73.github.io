### gem5

According to the [doc](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/), gem5 is a modular discrete event driven computer system simulator platform. That means that:

- gem5’s components can be rearranged, parameterized, extended or replaced easily to suit your needs.
- It simulates the passing of time as a series of discrete events.
- Its intended use is to simulate one or more computer systems in various ways.
- It’s more than just a simulator; it’s a simulator platform that lets you use as many of its premade components as you want to build up your own simulation system.

gem5 is written primarily in `C++ and python` and most components are provided under a BSD style license. It can simulate a complete system with devices and an operating system in full system mode (FS mode), or user space only programs where system services are provided directly by the simulator in syscall emulation mode (SE mode). There are varying levels of support for executing `Alpha`, `ARM`, `MIPS`, `Power`, `SPARC`, `RISC-V`, and `64 bit x86` binaries on CPU models including two simple single CPI models, an out of order model, and an in order pipelined model. A memory system can be flexibly built out of caches and crossbars or the Ruby simulator which provides even more flexible memory system modeling.

There are many components and features not mentioned here, but from just this partial list it should be obvious that gem5 is a sophisticated and capable simulation platform. Even with all gem5 can do today, active development continues through the support of individuals and some companies, and new features are added and existing features improved on a regular basis.

### gem5 usage

We can start our simulation by simply writing a configuration .py file. This .py file will define the system and how the system's components interact with each other. For extending the gem5's capabilities, one should add CPP code.

The simulation results can be found in "gem5/m5out" directory.

There is a [tutorial](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/) at HPCA 2023.

### gem5 resources

gem5 resources is a repository providing sources for artifacts that are known to be compatible with gem5.

gem5 resources contain components including disk images, kernels, applications, cross comilers, etc. that are not necessary for the compilation or running gem5 but may aid users in running simulations.

Sources for gem5 resources are held on [gem5's Google Cloud Bucket](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/). There is a [list](https://resources.gem5.org/resources.json) for looking up gem5 resources.

We can use the "materials/obtain-resources.py" script to obtain resources in the stdlib. Here is the example:

```python
from gem5.resources.resource import obtain_resource

resource = obtain_resource("riscv-disk-img")

print(f"The resource is available at {resource.get_local_path()}")
```
We can also use custom resource by specify the local resources. Here is the example:

```python
from gem5.resources.resource import CustomResource

CustomResource("<local_path>")
```
